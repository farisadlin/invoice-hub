## Technical Decisions

### Project Structure

The project follows a feature-first organization pattern where related code is grouped by feature rather than type. This makes the codebase more maintainable and scalable.

### Component Organization

```
src/components/invoices/
├── InvoiceForm.tsx           # Main component
├── types/                    # Types specific to invoice components
│   └── index.d.ts
├── styles/                   # Styles specific to invoice components
│   ├── InvoiceForm.styles.ts
│   └── InvoiceList.styles.ts
└── subcomponents/           # Smaller components used by main components
```

### Styling Strategy

- Each component has its own `.styles.ts` file located next to the component or in a `styles` folder if there are multiple style files
- Styles are colocated with their components for better maintainability
- Complex components with multiple style files have their own `styles` directory
- Using Emotion styled-components with Material-UI for consistent theming

### Type Definitions

- Types are organized based on component scope:
  - Shared types are in `src/types`
  - Feature-specific types are in their respective feature directories
  - Component-specific types are either in the component file or in a `types` directory if complex
- This organization ensures type definitions are as close as possible to where they're used

### State Management

- Using React's built-in useState for component-level state
- URL parameters for search and filter state
- Local storage for data persistence
- This approach keeps the app simple and avoids over-engineering
